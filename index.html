         and other matrials that are released into the atmosphere and environment. For example the mining of gold produse harmful
         by products such as acid and heavy metals which,if disposed of incorrently,rapidly killing and removing all aquic life

       <p>Thourgh out a computures lifespan it requires enegry to power. 
         If the electricity used to power the computer is generated using fossil fuels such a coal will take a toll on the planet.
       energy produce is the leadling producer of greenhouse gases with 1.65 billion metric tons of emmition in the US alone.These
       emissions make up about 72% of globle emissions. </p>
