         silica, iron, aluminum, copper, lead, tantalum, gold, cobalt and cadmium.which the mining of produce harmful gases 
         and other matrials that are released into the atmosphere and environment. For example the mining of gold produse harmful
         by products such as acid and heavy metals which,if disposed of incorrently,rapidly killing and removing all aquic life 
         in the area.In addition 3696 Megajoules of energy is used to produce a single computer;this energy can power a house for a month.   </p></td>

       <h2>Computer use</h2>
       <p>Thourgh out a computures lifespan it requires enegry to power. 
         If the electricity used to power the computer is generated using fossil fuels such a coal will take a toll on the planet.
       energy produce is the leadling producer of greenhouse gases with 1.65 billion metric tons of emmition in the US alone.These
       emissions make up about 72% of globle emissions. </p> <img src= https://www.arup.com/globalassets/images/insights/publications/rethinking-the-factory-banner.jpg width=50%>
      <h2>Disposal</h2>
    <p>If computers are disposed of incorrectly,ending up in landfills or incinerated, will release toxins 
         such as heavy metals,lead,mercury and cadmium, and polybrominated flame retardants  into 
        the environment destroying ecosystems  and negatively impacting human health. When heavy 
        metals enter the soil  and groundwater they release acid and toxins leading to the acidification 
          of nearby water supplies killing marine and freshwater organisms disturbing biodiversity. Polybrominated flame retardants
         pose a threat to the human liver,kidney and brain.<img src =https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/media-uploads/guide_waterpollution_66615937_2400.jpg? width=50%>
