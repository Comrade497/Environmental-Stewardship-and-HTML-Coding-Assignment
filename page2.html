        <td><p>As previously mentioned, the extraction of metals, particularly gold and cobalt, is very costly for
 the environment. This is why we should try to recycle materials used in the manufacturing of computers. In addition, implementing more sustainable practices in the extraction of these 
natural resources will also greatly benefit the environment.
